# BookScanner
Scripts I use to scan two pages at a time and the turn them sideways and cut them into pages and into PDF. Graphickmagick and Imagemagick needed. If pages does not fit, do no quit, but adjust them numbers in the script. Add "#! /bin/bash" as the first line, if computer is complaining.
